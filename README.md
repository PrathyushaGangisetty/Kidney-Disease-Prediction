# Kidney-Disease-Prediction

üß† Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Prediction Using Machine Learning and SMOTE
This project focuses on building a predictive model for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using a combination of machine learning algorithms and oversampling techniques. It was implemented in both Python (using libraries like Scikit-Learn, Keras, TensorFlow) and IBM SPSS Modeler for comparative performance evaluation.

Project Overview
Chronic Kidney Disease is a persistent condition affecting kidney function. Early detection is critical for effective treatment. This project uses classification algorithms such as SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Deep Neural Networks (ANN) to detect CKD with high accuracy, while handling data imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).

üéØ Objectives
Predict the presence of CKD from patient medical data.

Handle class imbalance using SMOTE.

Evaluate and compare multiple classification algorithms.

Implement both traditional ML models and ANN.

Perform feature selection to optimize accuracy.
